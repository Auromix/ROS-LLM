# ROS-LLM
The ROS-LLM project is a ROS framework for embodied intelligence applications. It enables natural language interactions and large model-based control of robot motion and navigation for any robot operating on ROS.

ROS-LLM empowers you to utilize functionalities based on Large Language Models, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, for robot decision-making and control. 

This framework is designed to be easy to extend. By simply providing a function interface for your robot, following the provided example, you can integrate and use ROS-LLM within ten minutes. 

ROS-LLM offers a simple solution for quickly creating interactive and control experiences with any robot.

## 🔥 Quickstart Guide

Follow the instructions below to set up ROS-LLM:

**1. Clone the Repository:**

Use the command below to clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Auromix/ROS-LLM.git
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

Navigate to the `llm_install` directory and execute the installation script.
```bash
cd ROS-LLM/llm_install
bash dependencies_install.sh
```

**3. Configure OpenAI Settings:**

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can obtain one from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com). Use the script below to configure your OpenAI API key.
```bash
cd ROS-LLM/llm_install
bash config_openai_api_key.sh
```

**4. Configure AWS Settings (Optional):**

For cloud natural interaction capabilities, configure the AWS settings. If you prefer to use local ASR, this step can be skipped.

For low-performance edge embedded platforms, it is recommended to use ASR cloud services to reduce computing pressure, and for high-performance personal hosts, it is recommended to use local ASR services to speed up response

```bash
cd ROS-LLM/llm_install
bash config_aws.sh
```

**4. Configure OpenAI Whisper Settings (Optional):**

For local natural interaction capabilities, configure the OpenAI Whisper settings. If you prefer to use cloud ASR, this step can be skipped.

For low-performance edge embedded platforms, it is recommended to use ASR cloud services to reduce computing pressure, and for high-performance personal hosts, it is recommended to use local ASR services to speed up response
```bash
pip install -U openai-whisper
pip install setuptools-rust
```

**5. Build the Workspace:**

Navigate to your workspace directory and build the workspace.
```bash
cd <your_ws>
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y  # Install dependencies
colcon build --symlink-install
```

**6. Run the Demo:**

Source the setup script and launch the Turtlesim demo with cloud ASR.
```bash
source <your_ws>/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch llm_bringup chatgpt_with_turtle_robot.launch.py
```
start listening
```bash
ros2 topic pub /llm_state std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'listening'" -1
```

## ⚙️ Configure Your Own Robot (Optional)

To use the framework with your own robot, modify the `llm_robot` and `llm_config` packages to suit your robot's specifications. This allows you to customize the behavior of your robot.


## 🧑‍💻 Future Development Plans

We are continuously striving to enhance ROS-LLM to better serve the developers and roboticists in the community. Below are the key developments we plan to undertake in the upcoming updates:

- [ ] Agent Mechanism

Adding an agent mechanism allows long sequence tasks to be well divided.

- [ ] Feedback Channel from External Functions

We plan to add a feedback mechanism for the robot to receive information from external functions. This would significantly assist model-based decision-making processes.

- [ ] Navigation Interface

A new interface for robot navigation is also in the pipeline. It will enable the utilization of this framework in navigation-oriented tasks.

- [ ] Sensor Input Interface

The addition of other sensor input interfaces is another major development. This will incorporate environmental perception into model decision premises, preparing for functionalities such as obstacle avoidance.

- [ ] Integration with Vision-based Models like Palm-e

We aim to extend the capabilities of ROS-LLM by integrating models that allow for visual input, like Palm-e. This would enable the use of advanced computer vision technologies for better environment interaction.

- [ ] Continuous Optimization

Last but not least, we will focus on continuous optimization of the framework. We are committed to improving the rationality and extensibility of ROS-LLM to make it easier for developers to customize and extend the framework according to their needs.
